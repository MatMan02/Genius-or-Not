# Genius-or-Not
An AI program that tells you if you are a genius or not by looking at a photo of you.

## How it works
Basically, I used ImageAI, the Google package for recognizing images, to train a model that distinguish between photos of geniuses (like Einstein, Hawking,...) from non geniuses. Of course it's just for fun and there are no serious stuffs in it. I dind't wanted to be racist or something, since this is a stupid thing, you can't tell if someone is a genius or not by looking at his face. anyway.

## How to run
Well, if you download the project you then should install ImageAI for Python. I used Pycharm and I suggest you to open the project with it, but feel free to use any editor (also no editor I think). Then you need to change the line of code that opens the image with the path of your personal photo you want to test the model with. Then it will print out percentages of Genius and Non-genius.

**I CREATED THIS JUST FOR FUN AND THERE IS NO INTENTION TO OFFEND OR HURT OR JUDGE ANYONE. I trained the model not so well, because, as I said, it was just to try, not to use it in reality.**

### You need ImageAI, Tensorflow and Python 3.7 (ImageAI still doesen't work with some versions of Tensorflow and Python so be sure to use these).
